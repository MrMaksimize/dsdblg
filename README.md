There are 2 branches that run the show, and two repositories as well.

The branch `src` resides in the "private" repo if you will and contains a bunch of drafts and things like that.

The branch master gets deployed when `gulp deploy` runs.

Drafts are able to be kept in `src` because of Jekyll's draft functionality.
